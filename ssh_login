>  At first we have to get rsa private key(id_rsa)
> Then we have to convert it into hashfile(id_rsa.hash)
> we wil use ssh2john .
> [ sudo python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash  ]
> Then we have to crack hash file 
> john --wordlist=darkweb2017-top10.txt id_rsa.hash
> john --show id_rsa.hash
> Then comes the cracked password if everything works perfectly.
>  To check the password in pot file:
   [ cat ~/.john/john.pot  ]   : we have to be the root to cat ~/ dir .

> Now we have to Login
> before login we have to give permission id_rsa file.
